Installing
==========

Installing the CLIrrus CLI tool is quick and easy.  Built using python `click`_ library and included in the broader `cirrus-geo`_ library, to install CLIrrus you just need to install the ``cirrus-geo`` project requirements.

For superior environment management we recommend you create a specific virtual environment.  This can be accomplised using your preferred environment management tools.  One way might be as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    python3.12 -m venv .venv

    source .venv/bin/activate

    pip install .
