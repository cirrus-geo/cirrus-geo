Deploying
=========

Cirrus-geo is designed to be agnostic to any particular method of deploying the
required AWS components.  This can be Serverless, Terraform, manual, or any
other method that suits organizational and project needs.

One option is to use Terraform.  An example fully realized Terraform deployment
can be found in the `Cirrus module`_ of the open source Filmdrop
repository.
