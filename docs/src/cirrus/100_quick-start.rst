# Quick Start


Previously Cirrus was based on the `Serverless`_ framework but has been changed to a Terraform deployment framework.  These Terraform definitions can be found in the `Cirrus module`_ of the open source Filmdrop repository.  This module represents a fully realized Cirrus deployment that can be deployed and built out of the box when deployed using Terraform.  Once you have cloned the repository you can make any changes to your cirrus deployment as your needs require prior to deployment.
