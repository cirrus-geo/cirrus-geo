Cirrus is a [STAC](https://stacspec.org/)-based geospatial processing pipeline platform,
implemented using a scalable architecture deployed on AWS. Cirrus provides the generic
infrastructure for processing, allowing a user to focus on implementing the specific
processing logic for their data.

As input, Cirrus takes a STAC ItemCollection, with a process definition block.
That input is called a Cirrus `ProcessPayload` (CPP).

An input is run through a workflow that generates one or more output STAC Items.
These output Items are added to the Cirrus static STAC catalog in S3,
and are also broadcast via an SNS topic. Subscriptions to that topic can
triggering additional workflows or external processes, such as indexing into a
STAC API catalog (e.g.,
[stac-server](https://github.com/stac-utils/stac-server)).

Cirrus workflows range from the simple publishing of unmodified input items to
the complex transformation of input Items and generation of wholly-new output
Items. The current state of CPP processing is tracked in a state database
to prevent duplicate processing and allow for a user to follow the state of any
input through the pipeline.

As shown in this high-level overview of Cirrus, users input data to Cirrus
through the use of _feeders_. Feeders are simply programs that get/generate
some type of STAC metadata, combine it with processing parameters, and pass it
into Cirrus as a CPP.

## Documentation

Documentation for deploying, using, and customizing Cirrus is contained
within the [docs](https://cirrus-geo.github.io/cirrus-geo/) directory:

- Learn how to [get
  started](https://cirrus-geo.github.io/cirrus-geo/stable/cirrus/10_intro.html)
- Understand the
  [architecture](https://cirrus-geo.github.io/cirrus-geo/stable/cirrus/20_arch.html)
  of Cirrus and key concepts
- [Use](https://cirrus-geo.github.io/cirrus-geo/stable/cirrus/30_payload.html)
  Cirrus to process input data and publish resulting STAC Items
- Cirrus features several [component
  types](https://cirrus-geo.github.io/cirrus-geo/stable/cirrus/60_components.html)
  that each represent a specific role within the Cirrus architecture

## About

Cirrus is an Open-Source pipeline for processing geospatial data in AWS.
Cirrus was developed by [Element 84](https://element84.com/) originally under a
[NASA ACCESS
project](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/competitive-programs/access) called
[Community Tools for Analysis of NASA Earth Observation System Data in the
Cloud](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/competitive-programs/access/eos-data-cloud).
