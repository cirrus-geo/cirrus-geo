# Cirrus

Cirrus is a [STAC](https://stacspec.org/)-based processing pipeline.
As input, Cirrus takes a GeoJSON FeatureCollection with 1 or more STAC Items
(an `ItemCollection` in pystack nomeclature), with a process definition block.
That input is called a cirrus `ProcessPayload` (CPP).

An input is run through a workflow that generates one or more output STAC Items.
These output Items are added to the Cirrus static STAC catalog in S3,
and are also broadcast via an SNS topic. Subscrptions to that topic can
triggering additional workflows or external processes, such as for keeping
a dynamic STAC catalog up to date (for example,
[STAC-server](https://github.com/stac-utils/stac-server)).

Cirrus workflows range from the simple publishing of unmodified input items to
the complex transformation of input Items and generation of wholly-new output
Items. The current state of CPP processing is tracked in a state database
to prevent duplicate processing and allow for a user to follow the state of any
input through the pipeline.

![](docs/images/highlevel.png)

As shown in this high-level overview of Cirrus, users input data to Cirrus
through the use of _feeders_. Feeders are simply programs that get/generate
some type of STAC metadata, combine it with processing parameters, and pass it
into Cirrus as a CPP.

Because Cirrus output is published via SNS, a Feeder can be configured to
subscribe to that SNS and thus workflows can be chained, such that the output
of one workflow becomes the input to another workflow, createing multiple levels
of products all with published STAC metadata and clear links showing data
provenance.

## Cirrus Development

If developing new code for cirrus-geo, checkout the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Cirrus Quickstart

A Cirrus project is managed via the `cirrus` cli tool.
Here's everything required to create, modify, and deploy a new project:

```
# Make a new directory for a project
❯ mkdir cirrus-project; cd cirrus-project

# Create a python virtual environment for isolation
❯ python -m venv .venv

# Activate our venv
❯ . .venv/bin/activate

# Install cirrus-geo
❯ pip install cirrus-geo
...

# Now we should have cirrus on our path
❯ cirrus
Usage: cirrus [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  cli for cirrus, a severless STAC-based processing pipeline

Options:
  --cirrus-dir DIRECTORY
  -v, --verbose           Increase logging level. Can be specified multiple
                          times.  [x>=0]
  --help                  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  build             Build the cirrus configuration into a serverless.yml.
  clean             Remove all files from the cirrus build directory.
  create            Create a new component in the project.
  init              Initialize a cirrus project in DIRECTORY.
  serverless (sls)  Run serverless within the cirrus build directory.
  show              Multifunction command to list/show components,
                    component...

# Fantastic!
# We can init our new project and see what all was created
❯ cirrus init
Succesfully initialized project in '/Users/jkeifer/cirrus-project'.

❯ ls
.venv/	cirrus.yml  /cloudformation  feeders/  functions/  package.json  tasks/  workflows/

# The cirrus.yml is almost good to go for a minimal install,
# but it does require a few parameters either set in the
# config or as environment variables:
#
#   custom:
#     batch:
#       SecurityGroupIds:
#         - ${env:SECURITY_GROUP_1}
#       Subnets:
#         - ${env:SUBNET_1}
#         - ${env:SUBNET_2}
#         - ${env:SUBNET_3}
#         - ${env:SUBNET_4}
#
# Use your favorite editor to set these values approriately
# based on your existing AWS resources.

# As we do have node.js dependencies from serverless,
# let's install those with the generated configuration
❯ npm install
...

## Cirrus Project Structure

A Cirrus project, most basically, is a directory containing a cirrus.yml
configuration file. However, several subfolders are used to organize
additional object definitions for custom implementations.

| Folder         | Purpose                                                            |
| :------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| cloudformation | Raw cloudformation templates to include in the project             |
| feeders        | Feeder Lambda functions used to add data to Cirrus                 |
| functions      | Misc Lambda functions required by a project                        |
| tasks          | Task Lambda function used within workflows                         |
| workflows      | AWS Step Function definitions describing data processing workflows |

## Cirrus Repositories

Cirrus is divided up into several repositories, all under the
[cirrus-geo](https://github.com/cirrus-geo) organization on GitHub,
with this repository (`cirrus-geo`) the main one of interest to users.

| Repository                                                             | Purpose                                                                                                                                         |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| cirrus-geo                                                             | Main Cirrus repo implementing the `cirrus` cli tool for managing Cirrus projects. Also provides the base set of lambda functions and workflows. |
| [cirrus-lib](https://github.com/cirrus-geo/cirrus-lib)                 | A Python library of convenience functions to interact with Cirrus. Lambda functions are kept lightweight                                        |
| [cirrus-task-images](https://github.com/cirrus-geo/cirrus-task-images) | Dockerfiles and code for publishing Cirrus Docker images to Docker Hub that are used in Cirrus Batch tasks                                      |

The `cirrus` cli utilitiy is what is used to create, manage, and deploy
Cirrus projects, and is pip-installable. The pip-installable python
library `cirrus-lib` is used from all Cirrus Lambdas and tasks and is
available to developers for writing their own tasks.
